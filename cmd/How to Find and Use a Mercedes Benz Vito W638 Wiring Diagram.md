For example, red wires are usually for power supply, black wires are for ground, green wires are for signal, etc.
- Trace the circuits. A wiring diagram shows how the components are connected in a circuit. You need to trace these circuits from the power source to the load, and identify any switches, relays, fuses, or sensors that are involved. This will help you understand how the circuit works, and where to look for problems.
- Use a multimeter. A multimeter is a device that can measure voltage, current, resistance, and continuity in a circuit.
