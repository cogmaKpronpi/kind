# Distributed Computing: A Comprehensive Textbook by Sunita Mahajan and Seema Shah
 
Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies how to design, implement, and manage systems that consist of multiple interconnected computers that cooperate to achieve a common goal. Distributed computing systems can range from simple local area networks to complex global networks of cloud servers, mobile devices, sensors, and embedded systems.

One of the challenges of distributed computing is to deal with the inherent heterogeneity, concurrency, communication, synchronization, fault tolerance, and security issues that arise in such systems. To help students and practitioners master these challenges, Sunita Mahajan and Seema Shah have written a comprehensive textbook on distributed computing that covers both the theoretical foundations and the practical applications of this field.
 
The book is divided into four parts: Part I introduces the basic concepts and techniques of distributed computing, such as network models, inter-process communication, synchronization, distributed algorithms, and distributed system architectures. Part II focuses on distributed system management, covering topics such as distributed file systems, distributed shared memory, distributed naming services, distributed directory services, and distributed security. Part III explores some advanced topics in distributed computing, such as real-time distributed systems, distributed databases, grid computing, ubiquitous computing, and .NET framework. Part IV presents several case studies of real-world distributed systems, such as Google File System, Hadoop MapReduce, CORBA, and Jini.
 
The book is written in a clear and concise style, with numerous examples, diagrams, exercises, review questions, and multiple choice questions. The book also provides online resources for instructors and students, such as lecture slides, solutions to exercises, and sample programs. The book is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students of computer science engineering, information technology, and computer applications. It can also serve as a useful reference for professionals and researchers working in the field of distributed computing.
  
The book Distributed Computing by Sunita Mahajan and Seema Shah is based on the syllabus prescribed by various universities and institutes in India and abroad. The book aims to provide a balanced coverage of both the theoretical and practical aspects of distributed computing, as well as to expose the students to the latest developments and trends in this field. The book also encourages the students to think critically and creatively about the design and implementation of distributed systems, and to apply the concepts and techniques learned in the book to solve real-world problems.
 
The authors of the book are well-qualified and experienced in the field of distributed computing. Sunita Mahajan is currently the Principal of the Institute of Computer Science, MET League of Colleges, Mumbai. She has a PhD from BARC, SNDT University in Mumbai, and has published several research papers in national and international journals. She is also a member of many committees and professional bodies, such as the Computer Society of India and Indian Women Scientists Association. Seema Shah is currently a senior faculty at Patni Computer Systems, Mumbai. She has around 20 years of academic experience teaching distributed computing, operating systems, computer organization, and other subjects. She has also presented research papers in several national and international conferences.
 
The book Distributed Computing by Sunita Mahajan and Seema Shah is available in both print and digital formats. The print version of the book can be purchased from Oxford University Press or any other online or offline bookstore. The digital version of the book can be downloaded as a PDF file from the Oxford University Press website or any other online platform. The book is priced at 1050 INR for the print version and 11 USD for the digital version.
